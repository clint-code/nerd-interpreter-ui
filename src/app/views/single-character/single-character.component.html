                            The Joker is a supervillain, who came to be in mainstream comic books back in the 1940s and was
                            created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane (the creator of the Batman) and Jerry Robinson.

                            The Joker doesn’t have superhuman abilities, but he’s a highly intelligent criminal mastermind.
                            He
                            commits sadistic crimes with a variety of goofey-thematic props such as: the joker venom and a
                            deck
                            of razor-tipped cards.

                            he was a criminal formerly known as the Red Hood who got into a confrontation with Batman in a

                            face
                            (which is beyond insane and sick) in the New 52, Death of the Family.
